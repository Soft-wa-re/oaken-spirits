To run your script as a daemon on Ubuntu to continually process data from a Kafka topic, you can create a systemd service unit. Systemd is the standard init system for many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up your script as a systemd service:

1. Create a Service File:
Create a systemd service unit file with a .service extension. You can place this file in /etc/systemd/system/ directory. For example, let's name the file mysql_kafka_processor.service.

2. Define the Service:
Open the service file (mysql_kafka_processor.service) in a text editor and define the service. Here's an example of what the service file might look like:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=MySQL Kafka Processor
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/script_directory
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Make sure to replace your_username, /path/to/your/script.py, and /path/to/your/script_directory with the appropriate values for your system.

3. Reload systemd:
After creating or modifying the service file, you need to reload systemd to recognize the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
```

4. Start the Service:
Once systemd has been reloaded, you can start your service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mysql_kafka_processor
```

5. nable Auto-Start (Optional):
If you want your service to start automatically at boot time, you can enable it:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mysql_kafka_processor
```

6. Check Service Status:
You can check the status of your service to ensure it's running without any issues:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql_kafka_processor
```

That's it! Your script should now be running as a daemon, continuously processing data from the Kafka topic. You can monitor its status, start, stop, or restart it using systemd commands. Make sure to handle any logging or error handling within your script itself, as systemd will capture the standard output and standard error streams.
